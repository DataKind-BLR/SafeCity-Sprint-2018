## About SafeCity

[Web](http://safecity.in/) | [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safecity)

[Safecity](http://safecity.in/) aims to make cities safer by encouraging equal access to public spaces for everyone especially women, through the use of crowdsourced data and technology. Since the launch on 26 Dec 2012 SafeCity has collected over 10,000 stories from over 50 cities in India, Kenya, Cameroon and Nepal. Main objective of the organisation is to:

• Create awareness on street harassment and abuse and get women and other disadvantaged communities to break their silence and report their personal experiences. 

• Collate this information to showcase location based trends.

• Make this information available and useful for individuals, local communities and local administration to solve the problem at the local level.

Target group are women/girls who are victims of sexual harassment. SafeCity is creating a new data set which currently does not exist and moves the focus away from the “victim” to the location so that people can view the issue with a different lens.

Also people can sign up for alerts either based on location or category of harassment. This allows people to understand the “safety” landscape of an area and make the most informed decision for themselves.
